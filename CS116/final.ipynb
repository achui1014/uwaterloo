    "    * Number 0-9\n",
    "    * Capital letters A-Z\n",
    "    * Lower case letters a-z\n",
    "    * Length of string\n",

    "* Strings can also be sliced using notation s[i:j] where:\n",
    "    * the substring starts AT index i and ends BEFORE index j\n",
    "    * There is an additonal parameter that allows you to slice subsequent characters from a string using a step k s[i:j:k]\n",
    "* A list of string methods can be printed via print(dir(str)) and print(help(\"\".stringmethod)) can be used to explain the use case of stringmethod.\n",
    "* The string method format allows us to create a set template for strings with placeholder {} which can then be replaced by the indexed parameters of format\n",
    "```\n",
    "\"My dog has {0} fleas and {0} bites and {1} infections\".format(12, 2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "prints: My dog has 12 fleas and 12 bites and 2 infections.\n",
    "* The newline character \\n counts is one character length.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Print\n",
    "* The function print produces a side effect in Python but returns the value None when called.\n",
    "    * Optional parameter (end= '') - Allows the next print statement to be printed right after the end value (ex. '\\n', ' ')\n",
    "* An Effects statement must be added to the Design Recipe of a function that includes print, and occurs immediately after the Purpose statement\n",
    "* The Purpose statement must niclude a description of what is printed and the Examples must include the actual values printed\n",
    "* This introduces 2 new check statements:\n",
    "    * check.set_screen - Sets things up for the user to self-validate the screen output. Typically used when the value printed is tedious to type.\n",
    "    * check.set_print_exact - Will check whether the screen output matches exactly what expected (more commonly used).\n",
    "* Note: The print statement can take on any value but if it a string, the quotations will not be included unless there are also quotations within the string. (ex. '\"String\"' will print \"String\")\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Input\n",
    "* The input function allows the function to define variables that are given by the user from the keyboard via a call\n",
    "```\n",
    "user_input = input(prompt)\n",
    "```\n",
    "* The prompt parameter is optional and tells the user what kind of value they are expecting in the form of a string message.\n",
    "* The Purpose statement must reflect that input is being read from the keybaord and what is being done with the value\n",
    "* The Effects statement must indicate that input is being read from the keyboard and the Tests must include the expected input and its outcome.\n",
    "    * check.set_input - Allows you to define an example of the expected input, followed by a check.expect to illustrate the outcome of the input value"

    "    * If any type of value is mutated, it must be refelected in both the Purpose and Effects statement\n",
    "    * You must also use a check.expect statement to check that your value is properly mutatednas expected\n",
    "* List indexing and slicing uses the exact same notation as the string indexing and slicing, and returns a new list\n",
    "* Lists are represented by arrows in the memory model and can thus form aliases with other variables. Thus when one variable is defined as the list in another variable, the memory model has one list with two arrows pointing to it.\n",
    "    * The consequences of this is that instead of creating a new copy of the list, it refers to the original list. This means that whatever changes are made to either of the variables will be made to the other as well.\n",

    "    * The list method copy only creates a shallow copy of the list (does not work on nested lists)\n",

    "#### Abstract List Functions\n",

    "    * list(map(f, L)) - Returns a new list with the function f applied to each of the objects in the list L.\n",
    "    * list(filter(f, L)) - Returns a new list with all the object in the list L that satisfy the conditions of the Boolean statement f.\n",
    "* lambda is commonly used with abstract list functions to create an anonymous functions that is only useful for the abstract list function.\n",
    "    * Allows you to define a function locally => Efficiency\n",
    "    * Can take any number of parameters\n",
    "* range is a useful function that returns a list of the number in the specified range\n",
    "    * The syntax for range is similar to that of list slicing and has the ability to take on 3 parameters:\n",
