    "## Module 7: Efficency\n",
    "### Motivation\n",
    "#### Choosing a Measure of Efficiency\n",
    "When evaluating a measure of efficiency, we can measure using any of the following considerations:\n",
    "* Easiest to understand\n",
    "* Easiest to implement\n",
    "* More accurate (important if using floating point numer)\n",
    "* Most robust (how easily the code deals with errors)\n",
    "* Most adaptable (how easily generalizable is the code)\n",
    "* Uses the least amount of time\n",
    "* Uses the least amount of space or memory\n",
    "### 7.2 Big-O Notation and Arithmetic\n",
    "Big-O notation is a way to measure the efficiency of code by measuring the growth rate of functions.\n",
    "by determining the **dominant** term in the two running times, that is, the term that grows the fastest as n grows large.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How does the runtime of the function grow as the size of the input grows?**\n",
    "\n",
    " The running time for each function is linear since the n term is the term that grows the fastest as n becomes larger. This is also known as linear time complexity, denoted by O(n). Whereas constant time and quadratic time can be expressed as O(1) and O(n^2), respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Big-O Notation Formal Definiton\n",
    "Let g be a real valued function mapping from natural (or real) numers to the real numbers. Then **O(g(n)) is the set of functions f mapping from the natural (or real) numbers to the real numbers such that there exists positive constants C and N satisfying \n",
    "```                     \n",
    "|f(n)|<=C|g(n)| for all n >= N\n",
    "```\n",
    "| Order | Name |\n",
    "| ----- | ---- |\n",
    "| O(1) | Constant|\n",
    "| O(logn) | Logarithmic |\n",
    "| O(n) | Linear |\n",
    "| O(nlogn) | Log Linear |\n",
    "| O(n^2) | Quadratic |\n",
    "| O(n^3) | Cubic |\n",
    "| O(2^n) | Exponential |\n",
    "\n",
    "The notation O(n) is determined by the function in which represents the amonut of time it takes to run the code as n increases. n can will vary from different types of functions and have an order of precedence. These relationships hold as n -> infinity, and the most efficient algorithm is the one with the lowest order since this grows slower.\n",
    "\n",
    "O(1) < O (logn) < O(n) < O(nlogn) < O(n^2) < O(n^3) < O(2^n)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Big-O Arithmetic\n",
    "When adding two orders, the result is the larger of the two orders.\n",
    "* this result is useful for analyzing sequential lines of code, without loops and recursion\n",
    "```\n",
    "O(|f(n)| + |g(n)|) = O(max(|f(n)|,|g(n)|)) \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When multiplying two orders, the result is the product of the two orders.\n",
    "* this is useful for calculating the running time of code in loops.\n",
    "```\n",
    "O(f(n)) * O(g(n)) = O(f(n)g(n))\n",
    "```\n",
    "### 7.3 - Analyzing Code without Loops or Recursion\n",
    "#### Algorithm Analysis\n",
    "The ability to determine the order of a program's running time allows us to make informed decisions and to be able to make deisgn decisions on programs based on what features we wish to optimize for.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Running time of Basic Arithmetic Operations\n",
    "We willl make the following assumptions for numerical operations in Python:\n",
    "* +, -, *, /, = are O(1)\n",
    "* max(x,y), min(x,y) are O(1) for integers x and y\n",
    "* x == y is O(1) for integers or Booleans x and y\n",
    "* return statements are O(1)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Running time of Basic String Operations\n",
    "For string operations, we suppose n = len(s) and m = len(t). We make the following assumptions:\n",
    "* len(s), s[k] are O(1)\n",
    "* s + t is O(n+m) = O(max(m,n))\n",
    "* Most string methods (eg. count, find, lower, index) are O(n)\n",
    "* s == t is O(min(m,n)) for strings s and t\n",
    "* print(s) and s=input() are O(n) (they depend on the length of what is being printed and read in)\n",
    "* The operation s in t takes O(mn) time (usually s is a small fixed size so this is almost aways O(m))\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Running time for Basic List Operations\n",
    "In what follows, we consider the case for lists L and M where n = len(L) and m = len(M) and make the following assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "len(L), L[k] are O(1) for any integer .\n",
    "* L == M is O(min(m,n)) for lists of integers L and M. Note for lists of strings this also depends on the length of the strings as well!\n",
    "* L + M is O(n+m)\n",
    "* L * k is O(nk) where k is a positive integer.\n",
    "* L + [x] is O(n+1) = O(n)\n",
    "* sum(L), max(L), min(L) are O(n)\n",
    "* L[a:b] is , so at most O(n)\n",
    "    * L[1:] is O(n-1) = O(n)\n",
    "    * L[3:5] is O(1)\n",
    "* L.append(x) is O(1)\n",
    "* range(n) is O(1)\n",
    "* list(range(n)) is O(n)\n",
    "* [x]*n is O(n)\n",
    "* Most other list methods on L (e.g., count, index, insert, pop, remove) are O(n)\n",
    "* L.sort() is O(nlogn)\n",
    "* L.extend(M) is O(m). Note that extend's run-time is independent of n\n",
    "* The operation e in L takes O(n) time (technically it might be longer depending on how long equality takes but we make the simplifying assumption here that equality is always fast).\n",
